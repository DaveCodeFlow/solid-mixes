DJ Mix Web page

This project is a simple static web page where I present my DJ mixes.
The mixes are manually added in JavaScript and dynamically rendered in the browser.

The goal of this project is twofold:
- To create my own Web page free of charge and without frameworks
- To further develop my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, particularly DOM manipulation and working with data structures

The Web page embeds my Mixcloud mixes and is entirely self-managed.

The project has been deliberately kept simple to focus on understandable, maintainable code and learning objectives.

## Realised improvements
- Filtering and sorting mixes
- Highlighting a featured mix
- Styling and responsive layout

## Future improvements
To be determined
